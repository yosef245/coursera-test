  <p>The OnePlus One (colloquially abbreviated to OPO) is an Android smartphone manufactured by OnePlus. Unveiled in April 2014, it is the first product by OnePlus. The One was designed to compare favorably – in performance, quality, and price – to flagship devices by leading smartphone manufacturers. The One ships to most markets with the Cyanogen OS operating system pre-installed. Cyanogen OS is a commercial variant of CyanogenMod.

The phone was first made available for sale on 25 April 2014, exclusively from the OnePlus website, but initially required prospective customers to obtain an invitation before they could purchase it. These invitations were primarily distributed by the company through contests, some of which attracted attention for their unconventional or controversial nature. On 6 June 2014, the device was available for general sale.[7]</p>

  <section class="col-lg-4 col-md-6 col-sm-12"><h4 id="p2t">OnePlus 2</h4>
  <p>The OnePlus 2 features a revamped design meant to put it at the top with the rest of its flagship competitors. The handset incorporates an aluminum-magnesium alloy chassis, with the volume and power keys along with the new notifications control switch featuring a polished stainless steel accent and with the rear of the phone accompanied with a textured Sandstone Black plastic back cover.[18][19] User also have the choice to customize back covers with choices of Kevlar or assorted wood offerings including bamboo, black apricot, and rosewood.[18]

Compared to its predecessor the phone is 1 mm shrunken height and width-wise but 8% thicker and heavier due in part to its larger 3,300 mAh battery.[20] The OnePlus 2 and its predecessor, the OnePlus One, have comparable displays, each 5.5" LCD 1920 x 1080 full HD resolution screens, with Corning Gorilla Glass protection. New to the OnePlus 2 is its fingerprint sensor which can optionally serve as a capacitive home button, along with back and multitasking navigation keys, but they can be disabled in favor of customizable navigation "soft keys" rendered on-screen.[21]</p></section>
  <section class="col-lg-4 col-md-12 col-sm-12"><h4 id="p3t">OnePlus 3</h4><p>The OnePlus 3 features a new metal back design, similar to that of an HTC M9 or later, with anodised aluminium and curved edges. The device is available in two colours, Graphite (black/grey) and Soft Gold (white/gold, released later at August 2016[8]). Additionally, users can purchase protective covers in Kevlar or black apricot wood, bamboo, rosewood, and sandstone which takes care of the camera hump and evens it with the phone.

The device is slightly smaller than its predecessor, the OnePlus 2. It's 2.5mm thinner, 0.9mm shorter, and 0.2mm narrower, but still has the same screen size, at 5.5in (139.7mm) across diagonally. The display is still 1920x1080p, comparable to that of the previous two models, but the 3 is the first flagship OnePlus to have an optic AMOLED display. As is typical for most smartphones, the OnePlus 3 features Corning Gorilla Glass 4 protection.[9]

The OnePlus 3 is also the first OnePlus phone to ship with only 64GB of storage available, as all other OnePlus devices have shipped with a 16GB option also. The onboard storage is UFS 2.0, but there is no option for memory expansion via an SD card. The OnePlus 3 does include a dual-sim card tray, but fails to have compatibility with LTE band 13,[10] making LTE unavailable to Verizon customers in the United States.</p></section>
